# PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: Practice proper coding practices. Calculate volume of a rectangular prism.


# VARIABLE DEFINITION

width = 0
height = 0
depth = 0
volume = 0

# INPUT

width = int(input("Please enter the width of the rectangular prism: "))
height = int(input("Please enter the height of the rectangular prism: "))
depth = int(input("Please enter the depth of the rectangular prism: "))

# PROCESSING

volume = width * height * depth

# OUTPUT
