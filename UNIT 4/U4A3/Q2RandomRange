# PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: Practice math modules. 


# VARIABLE DEFINITION

number1 = 0
number2 = 0
maxnumber = 0
minnumber = 0
rand1 = 0

# INPUT


#Explain to user what is happening.
print("Below you may enter 2 integers that will act as a range.\nThe program will give you a random number between said range.\n")


#promt user for 2 intergers
number1 = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
number2 = int(input("Please enter another integer: "))


# PROCESSING


import random


#define the max and min value as to not cause an error.
maxnumber = max(number1 , number2)
minnumber = min(number1 , number2)


#Sets a range, then picks a random number between said range.
rand1 = random.randint(minnumber, maxnumber)


# OUTPUT


#Displays random number to user.
print("\nIn the range of the numbers you choose. This is your RANDOM number: " + str(rand1))
